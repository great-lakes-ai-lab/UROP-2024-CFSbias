    "Here we will demonstrate a simple example of training a convolutional conditional neural process (ConvCNP) to spatially interpolate random grid cells of NCEP reanalysis air temperature data over the US. First, pip install the package. In this case we will use the PyTorch backend (note: follow the PyTorch installation instructions if you want GPU support).\n",
